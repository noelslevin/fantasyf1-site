<h1>About FantasyF1</h1>
<p>FantasyF1 is a game to provide a little more excitement to your F1 season. We all know, not every F1 race is exciting, so sometimes it can be nice to have something riding on it, and that's where this comes in</p>

<p>Every race, you get 45 points to spend on as many drivers as you can buy. You then score points according to where they finish in the race. However many points a driver scores in a race, you score the same number if you picked them. Most points wins. Simple!</p>

<p>No complicated rules about combinations of drivers, just take your points, spend them, and sit back in anguish every Sunday as their races seem to mysteriously mess up one by one! To find out a little more, check the <a href=/rules/ title="FantasyF1 rules">rules</a>.</p>
